Face Mask Detector

A Deep Learning project that classifies whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
This project demonstrates image classification and model evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras.

Features
- CNN built from scratch using Keras  
- Classifies **mask** vs **no mask** in real-world images  
- Visualizes model performance and accuracy  
- Trains and evaluates on open dataset  

Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  

Results
Achieved **~95% accuracy** on the test dataset after 5 epochs.  
The model generalizes well on unseen images.

How to Run
1. Open the Colab notebook: `Face_Mask_Detector.ipynb`  
2. Run all cells  
3. Test on your own face images (upload and run predictions)

Learning Outcome
- Image classification using CNNs  
- Data preprocessing with `ImageDataGenerator`  
- Real-world AI application for health and safety
